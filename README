INSTALLATION:

Clone the repo into your working directory.

USAGE: 

The recommended import strategy is:
from pfh import *

For just about every tag type in HTML there's a corresponding 
function.  That function will return text and takes any number of 
arguments.  There's no validation, so it helps to know HTML.

del, def, and object are namespace collisions with python, and 
are currently unimplemented.
    
Attributes are added as additional keyword arguments.  eg:

a('linky!', href="http://foo.com/bar/", alt='foo')

will generate:

<a alt="foo" href="http://foo.com/bar/">linky!</a>

a more elaborate example:

from pfh import *

def main():
    print html(head(title('foo')),
               body(h1('title'),
                    em('strong!'),
                    br(),
                    a('linky!', href="http://foo.com/bar/",
		      alt='foo')))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

Which, when run results in: 

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html>
<head><title>foo</title></head>
<body>
<h1>title</h1>
<em>strong!</em>
<br/>
<a alt="foo" href="http://foo.com/bar/">linky!</a>
</body>
</html>

Not the prettiest HTML, but servicable, and hopefully you won't 
need to use it much.
